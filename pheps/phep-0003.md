# Abstract
<a name="abstract"></a>
This PHEP recommends that all projects across the PyHC ecosystem adopt a common time-based policy for support of Python versions, similar to [SPEC 0](https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0000/). Specifically, it recommends that:
1. Support for Python versions be dropped **36 months** (3 years) after their initial release.
2. New Python versions be adopted within **6 months** of their release.

This policy will replace the current standard [#11](https://github.com/heliophysicsPy/standards/blob/main/standards.md#standards) which simply mandates Python 3 support.

# Motivation
<a name="motivation"></a>
The current PyHC standard [#11](https://github.com/heliophysicsPy/standards/blob/main/standards.md#standards), which mandates compatibility with Python 3, is outdated. Python 3 support is virtually universal now, so it would be more beneficial to replace this standard with a policy for how to support new minor Python versions. [SPEC 0](https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0000/) provides a structured support timeline that balances stability and progress, essential for software in the heliophysics community. Adopting a similar policy ensures consistency and predictability in support timelines. Additionally, limiting the scope of supported Python versions is an effective way for packages to limit maintenance burden while promoting interoperability.

# Rationale
<a name="rationale"></a>
Following [SPEC 0](https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0000/)'s 36-month support timeline ensures that PyHC packages maintain compatibility with newer Python features while providing adequate time for package maintainers to adapt. Allowing 6 months to adopt new Python versions ensures packages stay current with Python's development cycle while providing a reasonable timeframe for testing and integration.

# Specification
<a name="specification"></a>
This PHEP refers to feature releases of Python, i.e., updates to the minor version assuming semantic versioning (e.g., Python 3.12.0, not Python 3.12.1). 

This PHEP specifies that all PyHC packages should:
1. Drop support for Python versions **36 months** (3 years) after their initial release.
2. Adopt support for new Python versions within **6 months** of their release.

Since new minor Python versions are released annually every October ([PEP 602](https://peps.python.org/pep-0602/)), this effectively means that PyHC packages should be supporting about three minor Python versions at any given time. Providing ongoing support for older versions beyond this period is optional but not recommended. Packages should be tested against the minimum and maximum supported versions of Python.

This new policy will replace the current standard [#11](https://github.com/heliophysicsPy/standards/blob/main/standards.md#standards) in the PyHC standards document with the following new text:

> **11. Python Support:** All packages should support minor Python versions released only within the last 36 months (3 years). Additionally, packages should support new minor Python versions within 6 months of their release (see [PHEP 3](https://github.com/heliophysicsPy/standards/pull/29)). 

Lastly, if there is a Python 4, this policy will have to be reviewed in light of the community's and projects' best interests.

# Backwards Compatibility
<a name="backwards-compatibility"></a>
This policy introduces backwards incompatibilities by enforcing a new support timeline, which may require some packages to drop support for older Python versions sooner than planned.

# Security Implications
<a name="security-implications"></a>
There are no direct security implications of this policy. However, ensuring packages are updated to newer Python versions may indirectly improve security by incorporating fixes and improvements from newer releases.

# How to Teach This
<a name="how-to-teach-this"></a>
 - A new web page under the PyHC Projects page detailing the support schedule (similar to the Gantt chart in SPEC 0)? 
 - Automated email reminders sent near upcoming drop/support dates?

# Reference Implementation
<a name="reference-implementation"></a>
Multiple PyHC packages already follow this Python version support policy. One notable example is PlasmaPy which currently comments this policy above the `requires-python` line in their [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/blob/main/pyproject.toml#L24-L27) file.

## Code to generate support and drop schedules:
```python
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Define the release dates of the Python versions
py_releases = {
    "3.9": "Oct 5, 2020",
    "3.10": "Oct 4, 2021",
    "3.11": "Oct 24, 2022",
    "3.12": "Oct 2, 2023",
}

# Define the support periods of 3 years / 6 months
plus36 = timedelta(days=int(365 * 3))
plus6 = timedelta(days=int(365 * 0.5))

# Create a DataFrame from the predefined py_releases data
data = []
for version, release_date in py_releases.items():
    release_date_dt = datetime.strptime(release_date, "%b %d, %Y")
    drop_date_dt = release_date_dt + plus36
    support_by_dt = release_date_dt + plus6
    data.append((version, release_date_dt, support_by_dt, drop_date_dt))

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=["python version", "release", "support by", "drop"])
df["quarter"] = df["drop"].dt.to_period("Q")

# Save the DataFrame to a CSV file
df.to_csv('python_version_support_schedule.csv', index=False)

# Generate Mermaid syntax for the Gantt chart
mermaid_gantt = """gantt
    dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD
    title       Python Version Support Window
    axisFormat  %m / %Y

    section python
"""

for _, row in df.iterrows():
    mermaid_gantt += f"    {row['python version']} : {row['release'].strftime('%Y-%m-%d')},{row['drop'].strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}\n"

# Save the Mermaid syntax to a Markdown file
# The Mermaid Gantt chart syntax is saved in 'python_version_support_chart.md'.
# You can paste the content of that file into https://mermaid.live/ to generate the chart image.
with open("python_version_support_chart.md", "w") as file:
    file.write(mermaid_gantt)

print("Version support schedule saved to 'python_version_support_schedule.csv'")
print("Mermaid Gantt chart syntax saved to 'python_version_support_chart.md' (render at https://mermaid.live/)")
```

# Rejected Ideas
<a name="rejected-ideas"></a>
[NEP 29](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html)'s more lenient 42-month support timeline was originally considered instead of [SPEC 0](https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0000/)'s 36 months, but it was ultimately decided to follow SPEC 0 because it supersedes NEP 29.

# Open Issues
<a name="open-issues"></a>
1. What should go in the "How to Teach This" section?
2. Should we adopt the 2-year core package support policy from SPEC 0 in a separate PHEP? (`numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas, scikit-image, networkx, scikit-learn, xarray, ipython, zarr`)
