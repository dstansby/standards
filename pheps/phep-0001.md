# What is a PHEP?
PHEP stands for PyHC Enhancement Proposal. A PHEP is a design document providing information to the PyHC community, or describing a new standard for Python or its processes or environment. The PHEP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.

We intend PHEPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing major new standards, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into PyHC standards and recommendations. The PHEP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

Because the PHEPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal. This historical record is available by the normal git commands for retrieving older revisions, and can also be browsed on GitHub.

# PHEP Audience
The typical primary audience for PHEPs are the developers of PyHC packages, as well as developers of other implementations of the Python language specification.

However, other parts of the PyHC community may also choose to use the process (particularly for Informational PHEPs) to document expected conventions and to manage complex design coordination problems that require collaboration across multiple projects.

# PHEP Types
There are three kinds of PHEP:

1. A **Standards** Track PHEP describes a new standard for PyHC packages.
2. An **Informational** PHEP describes a PyHC design issue, or provides general guidelines or information to the PyHC community, but does not propose a new standard. Informational PHEPs do not necessarily represent a PyHC community consensus or recommendation, so users and implementers are free to ignore Informational PHEPs or follow their advice.
3. A **Process** PHEP describes a process surrounding PyHC, or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process PHEPs are like Standards Track PHEPs but apply to areas other than PyHC packages. They may propose an implementation; they often require community consensus; unlike Informational PHEPs, they are more than recommendations, and users are typically not free to ignore them. Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and changes to the tools or environment used in PyHC development or other Community activities. Any meta-PHEP is also considered a Process PHEP.

# PHEP Applicability
**Standards** Track PHEPs are recommended standards for PyHC packages. Most packages should make a good-faith effort to comply. PyHC core packages are strongly recommended to comply and generally should do so, absent a compelling reason not to. A PHEP which core packages cannot agree to implement likely does not have sufficient community support for approval. Standards track PHEP compliance should be considered as a factor in evaluating current and potential PyHC packages.

**Informational** PHEPs are for the benefit of PyHC developers and users and may represent "best practices". They are not binding.

**Process** PHEPs determine the process by which the PyHC community makes formal decisions and as such bind all participants in PyHC.

For all three kinds, key words in PHEPs must be interpreted according to [RFC2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119); the use of `must`, `must not`, `should`, and `should not` are preferred to the alternatives.

# PHEP Workflow
## PHEP Editors
<a name="phep-editors"></a>
The PHEP editors are individuals responsible for managing the administrative and editorial aspects of the PHEP workflow (e.g. assigning PHEP numbers and changing their status). See [PHEP Editor Responsibilities & Workflow](#phep-editor-responsibilities-workflow) for details.

PHEP editorship is by nomination of the current editors, subject to approval of the individuals or groups with statutory authority over the PyHC project. This may be the Principal Investigator or a steering committee or other such group as appropriately designated. In the event there are fewer than two active editors, such authority may appoint editors from active participants in the community, sufficient to bring the total to two.

The editors can be contacted by mentioning `@heliophysicsPy/pep-editors` on GitHub. All of the PHEP workflow is conducted via the GitHub PyHC standards repository issues and pull requests.

## Start with an idea
The PHEP process begins with a new idea for PyHC. It is highly recommended that a single PHEP contain a single key proposal or new idea; the more focused the PHEP, the more successful it tends to be. The PHEP editors reserve the right to reject PHEP proposals if they appear too unfocused or too broad. If in doubt, split your PHEP into several well-focused ones.

Each PHEP must have a champion - someone who writes the PHEP using the style and format described below, shepherds the discussions in the appropriate forums, and attempts to build community consensus around the idea. The PHEP champion (a.k.a. Author) should first attempt to ascertain whether the idea is PHEP-able. Posting to the PyHC mailing list or Element is usually the best way to go about this.

Vetting an idea publicly before going as far as writing a PHEP is meant to save the potential author time. Asking the Community first if an idea is original helps prevent too much time being spent on something that is guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions (searching the internet does not always do the trick). It also helps to make sure the idea is applicable to the entire community and not just the author. Just because an idea sounds good to the author does not mean it will work for most people in most areas.

Once the champion has asked the PyHC community as to whether an idea has any chance of acceptance, a draft PHEP should be presented to the appropriate venue mentioned above. This gives the author a chance to flesh out the draft PHEP to make properly formatted, of high quality, and to address initial concerns about the proposal.

## Submitting a PHEP
The proposal should be submitted as a draft PHEP via a [GitHub pull request](https://github.com/heliophysicsPy/standards/pulls). The draft must be written in PHEP style as described below, else it will fail review immediately (although minor errors may be corrected by the editors).

The standard PHEP workflow is:

* You, the PHEP author, fork the PHEP repository, and create a file named `phep-9999.md` that contains your new PHEP. Use "9999" as your draft PHEP number.
* In the "Type:" header field, enter "Standards Track", "Informational", or "Process" as appropriate, and for the "Status:" field enter "Draft". For full details, see [PHEP Header Preamble](#phep-header-preamble).
* Update [.github/CODEOWNERS](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners) such that any co-author(s) or sponsors with write access to the standards repository are listed for your new file. This ensures any future pull requests changing the file will be assigned to them.
* Push this to your GitHub fork and submit a pull request.
* The PHEP editors review your PR for structure, formatting, and other errors. Approval criteria are:
    * It is sound and complete. The ideas must make technical sense. The editors do not consider whether they seem likely to be accepted.
    * The title accurately describes the content.
    * The PHEP's language (spelling, grammar, sentence structure, etc.) should be correct and conformant. PHEPs with invalid MD markup will not be approved; here "invalid" include Markdown which provides clearly unintended output (in the discretion of the editors).

    Editors are generally quite lenient about this initial review, expecting that problems will be corrected by the reviewing process. **Note**: Approval of the PHEP is no guarantee that there are no embarrassing mistakes! Correctness is the responsibility of authors and reviewers, not the editors.

    If the PHEP isn't ready for approval, an editor will send it back to the author for revision, with specific instructions.

* Once approved, they will assign your PHEP a number. All PHEPs are sequentially-numbered at time of assignment. This includes meta-PHEPs. "Special" numbers (X, 0, etc.) are not used.

Once the review process is complete, and the PHEP editors approve it (note that this is not the same as accepting your PHEP!), they will squash commit your pull request onto main.

The PHEP editors will not unreasonably deny publication of a PHEP. Reasons for denying PHEP status include duplication of effort, being technically unsound, not providing proper motivation or addressing backwards compatibility, or not in keeping with the PyHC philosophy.

Standards Track PHEPs may consist of two parts, a design document and a reference implementation. It is generally recommended that at least a prototype implementation in an existing or new PyHC package be co-developed with the PHEP, as ideas that sound good in principle sometimes turn out to be impractical when subjected to the test of implementation.

## Discussing a PHEP
As soon as a PHEP number has been assigned and the draft PHEP is committed to the PHEP repository, a discussion thread for the PHEP should be created to provide a central place to discuss and review its contents, and the PHEP should be updated so that the `Discussions-To` header links to it.

The PHEP authors (or sponsor, if applicable) may select any reasonable venue for the discussion, so long as the the following criteria are met:

* The forum is appropriate to the PHEP's topic.
* The thread is publicly available on the web so that all interested parties can participate.
* The discussion is subject to the [PyHC Code of Conduct](https://heliopython.org/docs/code_of_conduct/).
* A direct link to the current discussion thread is provided in the PHEP under the `Discussions-To` header.

The PyHC mailing list is the preferred choice for most new PHEPs.

If a PHEP undergoes a significant re-write or other major, substantive changes to its proposed specification, a new thread should typically be created in the chosen venue to solicit additional feedback. If this occurs, the `Discussions-To` link must be updated and a new `Post-History` entry added pointing to this new thread.

PHEP authors are responsible for collecting community feedback on a PHEP before submitting it for review. However, to avoid long-winded and open-ended discussions, strategies such as soliciting private or more narrowly-tailored feedback in the early design phase, collaborating with other community members with expertise in the PHEP's subject matter, and picking an appropriately-specialized discussion for the PHEP's topic (if applicable) should be considered. PHEP authors should use their discretion here.

Once the PHEP is assigned a number and committed to the PHEP repository, substantive issues should generally be discussed on the canonical public thread, as opposed to private channels, GitHub pull request reviews or unrelated venues. This ensures everyone can follow and contribute, avoids fragmenting the discussion, and makes sure it is fully considered as part of the PHEP review process. Comments, support, concerns and other feedback on this designated thread are a critical part of what the community will consider when reviewing the PHEP.

## PHEP Review & Resolution
Once the authors have completed a PHEP, they may request a review for style and consistency from the PHEP editors. However, content review and acceptance of the PHEP is ultimately the responsibility of the community once the authors (and sponsor, if any) determine the PHEP is ready for final review and resolution. A PHEP is accepted when approved by consensus of attendees (virtual or in-person) at both a PyHC biweekly telecon and a biennial PyHC meeting with no edits to the PHEP occurring in between. Potential approval of a PHEP must be placed on the agenda at least a month before the meeting, including a link to the proposed-final language of the PHEP. Persons not in attendance at the meetings may object via email or Element chat, ensuring that the PHEP author is notified.

For a PHEP to be accepted it must meet certain minimum criteria. It must be a clear and complete description of the proposed enhancement. The enhancement must represent a net improvement. The proposed implementation, if applicable, must be solid and must not complicate the interpreter unduly. Finally, a proposed enhancement must be "pythonic" in order to be accepted by the community. (However, "pythonic" is an imprecise term; it may be defined as whatever is acceptable to the community. This logic is intentionally circular.)

Pronouncements of PHEP resolution will be posted to the PHEPs category on the Python Discourse.

Once a PHEP has been accepted, the reference implementation, if applicable, must be completed. When the reference implementation is complete and incorporated into a PyHC project's source code repository, the status will be changed to "Final". PHEPs which do not require a reference implementation move immediately to "Final".

If a PHEP requires additional design and interface feedback before committing to long term stability, it must remain in "Draft". Alternatively, its scope can be reduced (e.g. by deferring some features to later PHEPs).

If no progress is being made on the PHEP, the editor should consult the author. The author may resume work on the PHEP, [transfer it to another author](transferring-phep-ownership), or withdraw it. If the author takes none of these actions, the editor may choose to bring the PHEP to the community for approval or rejection in its current form.

A PHEP can also be "Rejected" if it fails community approval and the author is not willing or able to modify it. Perhaps after all is said and done it was not a good idea. It is still important to have a record of this fact. The "Withdrawn" status is similar - it means that the PHEP author themselves has decided that the PHEP is actually a bad idea, or has accepted that a competing proposal is a better alternative.

When a PHEP changes state, the PHEP text must be updated accordingly. In addition to updating the Status field, at the very least the Resolution header should be added with a direct link to the relevant post making a decision on the PHEP.

PHEPs can also be replaced by a different PHEP, rendering the original obsolete.

The possible paths of the status of PHEPs are as follows:

![PHEP status flow diagram](phep-0001/process_flow.svg)

While not shown in the diagram, "Accepted" PHEPs may technically move to "Rejected" or "Withdrawn" even after acceptance. This will only occur if the implementation process reveals fundamental flaws in the design that were not noticed prior to acceptance of the PHEP.

## PHEP Maintenance
<a name="phep-maintenance"></a>
PHEPs are no longer substantially modified after they have reached the Accepted, Final, Rejected, Withdrawn, or Replaced state. Once resolution is reached, a PHEP is considered a historical document rather than a living specification and the PHEP number is a permanent identifier for the document.

If changes based on implementation experience and user feedback are made to PHEPs while in the Accepted state, they should be noted in the PHEP, such that the PHEP accurately describes the implementation at the point where it is marked Final.

Rejected and Withdrawn PHEPs must not be resurrected but may be used as the basis for a new PHEP.

Changes to PHEPs in the Final state are limited to the preamble1, and only in the event the PHEP is replaced. Final PHEPs are immutable and must be replaced by new PHEPs if necessary, rather than updated. The scope of a PHEP should be carefully considered in this light.

# What belongs in a successful PHEP?
Each PHEP should have the following parts/sections:

1. Preamble - [RFC 2822](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2822.html) style headers containing meta-data about the PHEP, including the PHEP number, a short descriptive title (limited to a maximum of 44 characters), the names, and optionally the contact info for each author, etc.
2. Abstract - a short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.
3. Motivation - The motivation is critical for PHEPs that want to change the PyHC or ecosystem. It should clearly explain why the existing standards are inadequate to address the problem that the PHEP solves. This can include collecting documented support for the PHEP from important projects in the PyHC ecosystem. PHEP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected.
4. Rationale - The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages.

    The rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the community and discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.

5. Specification - The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new standard. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations.
6. Backwards Compatibility - All PHEPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The PHEP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. PHEP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.
7. Security Implications - If there are security concerns in relation to the PHEP, those concerns should be explicitly written out to make sure reviewers of the PHEP are aware of them.
8. How to Teach This - For a PHEP that adds new functionality or changes behavior, it is helpful to include a section on how to teach users, new and experienced, how to apply the PHEP to their work.

    This section may include key points and recommended documentation changes that would help users adopt a new feature or migrate their code to use a language change.

9. Reference Implementation - The reference implementation must be completed before any PHEP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the PHEP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.

    The final implementation must include test code and documentation appropriate for the relevant PyHC project(s).

10. Rejected Ideas - Throughout the discussion of a PHEP, various ideas will be proposed which are not accepted. Those rejected ideas should be recorded along with the reasoning as to why they were rejected. This both helps record the thought process behind the final version of the PHEP as well as preventing people from bringing up the same rejected idea again in subsequent discussions.

    In a way this section can be thought of as a breakout section of the Rationale section that is focused specifically on why certain ideas were not ultimately pursued.

11. Open Issues - While a PHEP is in draft, ideas can come up which warrant further discussion. Those ideas should be recorded so people know that they are being thought about but do not have a concrete resolution. This helps make sure all issues required for the PHEP to be ready for consideration are complete and reduces people duplicating prior discussion.
12. Footnotes - A collection of footnotes cited in the PHEP, and a place to list non-inline hyperlink targets.
13. Copyright/license - Each new PHEP must be placed under a dual license of public domain and [CC0-1.0-Universal](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/cc0-1.0/) (see this PHEP for an example).

# PHEP Formats and Templates
PHEPs are UTF-8 encoded text files using the Markdown format. Markdown allows for rich markup that is still quite easy to read, but also results in good-looking and functional HTML. A future PHEP may include a template. PHEP Markdown must be compatible with the most recent version of the [CommonMark specification](https://spec.commonmark.org/) at the time the PHEP is approved. PHEPs must not use [GitHub extensions](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

PHEPs should be restricted to the ASCII subset of UTF-8 where practicable. Examples of cases where it is not practicable include the inclusion of personal names.

The PHEP text files are automatically rendered by the GitHub interface for easier online reading. The Markdown source is the version of record.

The readability of the diff should be considered when editing a PHEP.

# PHEP Header Preamble
<a name="phep-header-preamble"></a>
Each PHEP must begin with an [RFC 2822](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2822.html) style header preamble. The headers must appear in the following order. Headers marked with "*" are optional and are described below. All other headers are required.

      PHEP: <phep number>
      Title: <phep title>
      Author: <list of authors' real names and optionally, email addrs>
      Discussions-To: <URL of current canonical discussion thread>
      Status: <Draft | Accepted | Rejected |
               Withdrawn | Final | Superseded>
      Type: <Standards Track | Informational | Process>
      Content-Type: text/markdown; charset=UTF-8; variant=CommonMark
    * Requires: <pep numbers>
      Created: <date created on, in dd-mmm-yyyy format>
      Post-History: <dates, in dd-mmm-yyyy format,
                     inline-linked to PHEP discussion threads>
    * Replaces: <pep number>
    * Superseded-By: <pep number>
    * Resolution: <url>

The Author header lists the names, and optionally the email addresses of all the authors/owners of the PHEP. The format of the Author header values must be:

`Random J. User <random@example.com>`

if the email address is included, and just:

`Random J. User`

if the address is not given.

If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line following [RFC 2822](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2822.html) continuation line conventions. Note that personal email addresses in PHEPs will be obscured as a defense against spam harvesters.

The Discussions-To header provides the URL to the current canonical discussion thread for the PHEP. For email lists, this should be a direct link to the thread in the list's archives, rather than just a mailto: or hyperlink to the list itself.

The Type header specifies the type of PHEP: Standards Track, Informational, or Process.

The optional Topic header lists the special topic, if any, the PHEP belongs under. See the Topic Index for the existing topics.

The format of a PHEP is specified with a Content-Type header. All PHEPs must use Markdown, and have a value of `text/markdown; charset=UTF-8; variant=CommonMark`.

The Created header records the date that the PHEP was assigned a number, while Post-History is used to record the dates of and corresponding URLs to the Discussions-To threads for the PHEP, with the former as the linked text, and the latter as the link target. Both sets of dates should be in `dd-mmm-yyyy` format, e.g. `14-Aug-2001`.

PHEPs may have a Requires header, indicating the PHEP numbers that this PHEP depends on.

PHEPs may also have a Superseded-By header indicating that a PHEP has been rendered obsolete by a later document; the value is the number of the PHEP that replaces the current document. The newer PHEP must have a Replaces header containing the number of the PHEP that it rendered obsolete.

# Auxiliary Files
PHEPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams. Such files should be named `phep-XXXX-Y.ext`, where "XXXX" is the PHEP number, "Y" is a serial number (starting at 1), and "ext" is replaced by the actual file extension (e.g. "png").
Alternatively, all support files may be placed in a subdirectory called `phep-XXXX`, where "XXXX" is the PHEP number. When using a subdirectory, there are no constraints on the names used in files.

# Changing Existing PHEPs
Draft PHEPs are freely open for discussion and proposed modification, at the discretion of the authors, until submitted for review and resolution. Substantive content changes should generally be first proposed on the PHEP's discussion thread listed in its `Discussions-To` header, while copyedits and corrections can be submitted as a GitHub issue or GitHub pull request. PHEP authors with write access to the PHEP repository can update the PHEPs themselves by using git push or a GitHub PR to submit their changes. For guidance on modifying other PHEPs, consult the PHEP Maintenance section.

See the Contributing Guide for additional details, and when in doubt, please check first with the PHEP author and/or a PHEP editor.

# Transferring PHEP Ownership
<a name="transferring-phep-ownership"></a>
It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of PHEPs to a new champion. In general, it is preferable to retain the original author as a co-author of the transferred PHEP, but that's really up to the original author. A good reason to transfer ownership is because the original author no longer has the time or interest in updating it or following through with the PHEP process, or has fallen off the face of the 'net (i.e. is unreachable or not responding to email). A bad reason to transfer ownership is because the author doesn't agree with the direction of the PHEP. One aim of the PHEP process is to try to build consensus around a PHEP, but if that's not possible, an author can always submit a competing PHEP.

If you are interested in assuming ownership of a PHEP, you can also do this via pull request. Fork the `standards` repository, make your ownership modification, and submit a pull request. You should mention both the original author and `@heliophysicsPy/phep-editors` in a comment on the pull request. (If the original author's GitHub username is unknown, use email.) If the original author doesn't respond in a timely manner, the PHEP editors will make a unilateral decision (it's not like such decisions can't be reversed :).

# PHEP Editor Responsibilities & Workflow
<a name="phep-editor-responsibilities-workflow"></a>
A PHEP editor must be added to the `@heliophysicsPy/pep-editors` group on GitHub and must watch the `standards` repository.

Other community members with write access to the `standards` repository may handle the tasks that would normally be taken care of by the PHEP editors. Alternately, even those with write access may request assistance from PHEP editors by mentioning `@heliophysicsPy/phep-editors` on GitHub.

For each new PHEP that comes in an editor does the following:

* Read the PHEP to check if it is ready: sound and complete. The ideas must make technical sense, even if they don't seem likely to be accepted.
* The title should accurately describe the content.
* The file name extension is correct (i.e. `.md`).
* Ensure that everyone listed as a co-author of the PHEP who has write access to the PHEP repository is added to [.github/CODEOWNERS](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners).
* Skim the PHEP for obvious defects in language (spelling, grammar, sentence structure, etc.). Editors may correct problems themselves, but are not required to do so.
* If a project is portrayed as benefiting from or supporting the PHEP, make sure there is some direct indication from the project included to make the support clear. This is to avoid a PHEP accidentally portraying a project as supporting a PHEP when in fact the support is based on conjecture.

If the PHEP isn't ready, an editor will send it back to the author for revision, with specific instructions. If Markdown formatting is a problem, ask the author(s) to resubmit.

Once the PHEP is ready for the repository, a PHEP editor will:

* Assign a PHEP number (almost always just the next available number, but sometimes it's a special/joke number, like 666 or 3141).
* Check that the author has correctly labeled the PHEP's type ("Standards Track", "Informational", or "Process"), and marked its status as "Draft".
* Merge the new (or updated) PHEP.
* Inform the author of the next steps (open a discussion thread and update the PHEP with it, post an announcement, etc).

Updates to existing PHEPs should be submitted as a GitHub pull request.

PHEP editors don't pass judgment on PHEPs. They merely do the administrative & editorial part (which is generally a low volume task). They may participate in the community discussion of a PHEP but have no obligation to be advocates.

Disagreements with editors must be mediated by those with the authority to approve editors (as documented in [PHEP editors](#phep-editors)) and they may impose sanctions, up to and including removal of the editor role.
